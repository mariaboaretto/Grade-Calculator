# Grade-Calculator

## About
This is a simple grade calculator I created to practice what I have learned in C so far. It takes the grades of a class and it prints the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the grade average of the class.

## How to run

```bash
$ gcc gradecalculator.c -o out
$ ./out 
```
